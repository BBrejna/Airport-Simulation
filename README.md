# Airport Simulation Project Readme

## Overview
Welcome to the Airport Simulation project made for a Structural and Object-Oriented Programming course @ Wrocław University of Science and Technology! 

This collaborative effort involves seven team members working together to create a simulation of arrivals and departures at an airport. The simulation incorporates weather randomization and delays calculation to provide a realistic and dynamic experience.

## Project Description
The Airport Simulation project aims to replicate a day of activity at a chosen airport with randomized flights and passengers, taking into account the uncertainties introduced by random weather conditions and the potential for delays.

## Team Leader
- Bartosz Brejna

## Team Members
- Bartosz Wacławiak
- Jeremiasz Lizak
- Franciszek Dobrzyński
- Dominik Gabiś
- Jakub Barteczka
- Jan Kuffel

## Features
1. **Arrivals and Departures Simulation:** Simulate the flow of incoming and outgoing flights throughout the day.
2. **Weather Randomization:** Introduce random weather conditions to add variability to the simulation.
3. **Delays Calculation:** Implement a delay mechanism to reflect real-world scenarios that may affect flight schedules.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide a clear and intuitive interface for users to interact with the simulation.
5. **Data Logging:** Record relevant data during the simulation for analysis and evaluation purposes.

## Requirements
- Java 21.0.1
- JavaFX 21.0.1
- JUnit 5.8.1
